h2. Filtering

You can filter any request by passing a hash to the filter option.

bc. # Only show survey responses that have been made after 1 January 2012
Surveygizmo.survey_responses(survey_id, filter: { field: "datesubmitted", operator, ">=", value: "2012-01-01"})

You can add multiple filters by passing an array of hashes.

bc. # Show responses made in January 2012
Surveygizmo.survey_responses(survey_id, filter: [{ field: "datesubmitted", operator, ">=", value: "2012-01-01"}, {field "datesubmitted", operator: "<=", value: "2012-01-31"])
